# Game Of Life
This project is an enhanced version of Conway's Game Of Life. The project has the abilities to simulate population in the traditional way, as well as in a randomised way.  All probabilitys can be changed dynamicly. It also features a virus simulation and multiple cell types, that can interact dynamically with each other. The project is written in JavaScript with the Vue.js framework.
